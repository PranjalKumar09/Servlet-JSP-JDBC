: A shadow variable occurs when a variable declared in a narrower scope (e.g., local variable or parameter) has the same name as a variable in a wider scope (e.g., instance or class variable). The local variable hides (shadows) the outer variable within its scope.




private int j; // Instance variable
    void showJ() {
        while (j <= 5) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= 5;) { // Local variable j shadows instance j
                System.out.print(j + " "); // Uses local j
                j++; // Increments local j
            }
            j++; // Increments instance j
        }
    }



       int[] a = null;  is valid

       a[expression];
       expression calculated first then proceeded



String  s = null;
s = s + 'a'; // -> nulla





There no unsigned keyword in java! A char can be used as an unsigned integer.




The try-with-resource was enhanced in Java 9 and it now allows you to use a variable declared before the try statement in the try-with-resource block as long as it is final or effectively final. For example, the following is valid since Java 9:

Statement stmt = c.createStatement();
try(stmt){
  ...
}
However, try(stmt = c.createStatement();) is still invalid.







lon.parallelStream().reduce(5, Integer::sum);  this will return /
each time different result





StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("12345678");
      sb.setLength(5); // 12345
      sb.setLength(10);// 12345_____ //10
      System.out.println(sb.length()); //10\


Locale can crearted one , cant 




NumberFormat can used for -ve   



(Type) expression, the expression (here, y.val) is always evaluated before the cast because the cast operator requires the value produced by the expressi

. has higer prescdence than type 




print(grade1.orElse("UNKNOWN")) will print UNKNOWN and not Optional[UNKNOWN].\




in enum it should short not long, means not  case Switch.OFF , just case OFF








case 80, default   //CE default cant be with case
