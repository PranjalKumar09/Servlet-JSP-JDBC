        Loose Coupling
        
        Inversion of Control
            Design principle where control of object creation & life cycle management is transferred from application & life cycle management from application code to an extern al container or framework

        Dependency Injection
            Dependency injection are provide externally rather than being created within class itself

        Beans
            Object that managed by Framework
    

    Type of Spring Container
            ApplicationContext
            BeanFactory
        
        We will tell object by configuration -> ConfigurationFile
        
        ConfigurationFile -> declare beans etc..
