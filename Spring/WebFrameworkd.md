# Why We Need a Web Framework

Websites share common requirements such as security, databases, URLs, and authentication. A web framework provides pre-fabricated components to:

- Assemble applications faster
- Reduce errors

In essence, a web framework is a collection of tools and modules necessary for standard tasks across web applications.

## Popular Web Frameworks
- **Spring Boot** (Java)
- **Django** (Python)
- **Flask** (Python; smaller than Django)
- **Express** (JavaScript)
- **Ruby on Rails** (Ruby)
