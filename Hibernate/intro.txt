    getReference used not load, also to load use,
    difference between using  session.getReference, and get ,

    getReference vs get difference

    getregrence is done only when it called

    in get if same object called multiple times then value stored in it it return the same thing

            Employee emp = session.getReference(Employee.class,1);
    @Override
        public String toString() {
            return "Employee [id=" + id + ", empName=" + empName + ", salary=" + salary + ", joiningDate=" + joiningDate
                    + ", email=" + email + ", status=" + status + ", token=" + token + "]";
        }
