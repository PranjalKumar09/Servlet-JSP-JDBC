## **Java Overview**
- **Java** is a **technology** (not just a programming language) designed for developing:
  - Object-Oriented applications
  - Platform-independent applications

### **Platform**
- **Definition**: An environment where a program runs; it is a combination of the **Operating System (OS)** and the **Processor (CPU)**.
  - Examples of platforms: Windows, Linux, MacOS, Windows, MacOS
  - Total Platforms: Physical Machines = 5, Platforms = 3

## **Key Features of Java**

### 1. **Platform Independence**
- Java achieves platform independence through:
  - **Bytecode**: Machine-independent code generated by the Java Compiler.
  - **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**: Converts bytecode to machine-specific code, allowing execution on any platform where a JVM is available.
  - **WORA (Write Once, Run Anywhere)**: Java code can be run on any machine with a compatible JVM.

### 2. **Automatic Memory Management**
- Unlike C/C++, where memory allocation (`malloc`, `new`) and deallocation (`free`, `delete`) are manual, Java features:
  - **Automatic Garbage Collection**: The JVM automatically manages memory, deallocating objects no longer in use.

### 3. **Security**
- Java enhances security by:
  - Avoiding explicit use of pointers.
  - Running programs in a **sandbox** environment.
  - Employing bytecode verification to ensure compliance with Java security constraints.

### 4. **Robustness**
- Java is designed with strict rules that prevent common programming errors:
  - The JVM terminates programs that violate these rules by generating exceptions.
  - Example: Accessing an out-of-bounds array element results in an exception rather than unpredictable behavior.

### 5. **Simplicity**
- Java simplifies programming by:
  - Borrowing syntax from C/C++ while eliminating complex features such as pointers and multiple inheritance.

### 6. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- Java supports key OOP principles:
  - **Encapsulation**
  - **Inheritance**
  - **Polymorphism**
  - **Abstraction**

### 7. **Multithreading**
- **Definition**: The ability to execute multiple threads (parts of a program) simultaneously.
  - Examples include:
    - Opening multiple tabs in a browser.
    - Performing multiple actions in a media player (e.g., playing music, adjusting volume).

### 8. **Distributed Computing**
- Java facilitates distributed programming, allowing applications to run on multiple computers and communicate over a network.

## **Java Editions**
1. **Java Standard Edition (JSE)**:
   - Core Java for developing desktop applications (e.g., calculators, media players).
  
2. **Java Enterprise Edition (JEE)**:
   - Built on JSE for developing large-scale, server-side applications (e.g., e-commerce sites like Amazon, IRCTC).
  
3. **Java Micro Edition (JME)**:
   - A lightweight version of Java for small devices (e.g., mobile phones, smartcards). Its usage has decreased with the rise of Android.

---

## **Java Components**
- **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**: 
  - An abstract machine that executes Java bytecode.
  - Components:
    - **Interpreter**: Converts bytecode to machine code.
    - **Garbage Collector**: Manages memory automatically.

- **JRE (Java Runtime Environment)**:
  - Contains the JVM and Java class libraries needed to run Java programs.
  - Essential for executing Java applications.

- **JDK (Java Development Kit)**:
  - A comprehensive package for developing Java applications, including:
    - The JRE
    - Java compiler (`javac`)
    - Development tools
  - **JDK = JRE + Development Tools**

---

## **Java Program Execution**
- **Main Method**: 
  - Entry point for Java applications; defined as `public static void main(String[] args)`.
- **Static Methods**: 
  - Can be invoked without an object instance.
  
- **Command-Line Arguments**: 
  - Passed to the `main()` method as an array of Strings (`String[] args`).

---

## **Java Primitive Data Types and Wrapper Classes**
### **Primitive Data Types**:
- Java supports eight primitive data types:
  - `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `char`, `boolean`.

### **Wrapper Classes**:
- Classes that provide a way to use primitive data types as objects:
  - `Integer`, `Character`, `Float`, `Boolean`, etc.
  - **Key Functions**:
    - Convert between primitive types and their corresponding wrapper classes.
    - Example: `Integer.parseInt("10")` converts a String to an int.

---

## **Arithmetic Operations in Java**

1. **Integer Division**:
   - If both numerator and denominator are integers, the result is an integer (e.g., `10 / 4 = 2`).

2. **Floating Point Division**:
   - If either operand is a float or double, the result is a floating-point value (e.g., `10 / 4.0 = 2.5`).

3. **Modulo Operator (%)**:
   - Returns the remainder of a division.
   - Example:
     - Integer: `10 % 3 = 1`
     - Floating-point: `10.5 % 5.0 = 0.5`

4. **String Concatenation**:
   - The `+` operator can concatenate strings with other data types.
   - Example: `String message = "The result is: " + 10;` results in "The result is: 10".

---

## **Variable Types in Java**

1. **Local Variables**:
   - Declared within methods; must be initialized before use.
   - Example:
     ```java
     class Test {
         public static void main(String args[]) {
             int a; 
             System.out.println("Value of a is: " + a);  // Error: Variable 'a' might not have been initialized
         }
     }
     ```

2. **Instance Variables (Class-Level Variables)**:
   - Declared inside a class but outside any method.
   - Automatically initialized with default values (0 for numbers, false for booleans).
   - Example:
     ```java
     class Student {
         int roll;  // Default value is 0
         public void show() {
             System.out.println("Roll is: " + roll);  // Prints default value of 0
         }
     }
     ```

3. **Static Variables**:
   - Shared across all instances of a class and can be accessed without creating an object.
   - Example:
     ```java
     class Counter {
         static int count = 0;  // Static variable
     }
     ```

---

## **Static Methods and Math Operations**

- **Accessing Static Members**:
  - Static methods and variables can be accessed without creating an instance of a class.
  - Example: `double piValue = Math.PI;`

- **Math Class**:
  - It already included so no need to be include that explicitly
  - Provides various mathematical operations.
  - Example: 
    ```java
    double result = Math.pow(2, 3); // Result: 8.0 (2^3)
    ```

---

## **User Input in Java**

1. **Command-Line Arguments**:
   - Example:
     ```java
     class Test {
         public static void main(String[] args) {
             System.out.println("Hello " + args[0]); // Run with 'java Test Sachin'
         }
     }
     ```

2. **Using Scanner Class**:
   - For reading user input from the console.
   - Example:
     ```java
     import java.util.Scanner;
     class InputExample {
         public static void main(String[] args) {
             Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
             System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
             int number = scanner.nextInt();
             System.out.println("You entered: " + number);
             scanner.close();
         }
     }
     ```

3. **Using GUI Components**: 
   - For creating graphical user interfaces to receive user input.

---

## **Exception Handling**

- **NumberFormatException**: Occurs when trying to convert a non-integer string using `Integer.parseInt()`.
- Example:
  ```java
  String str = "20.5";
  int num = Integer.parseInt(str);  // Throws NumberFormatException
  ```

---

## **Type Conversions**

- **Implicit Conversion**:
  - Performed automatically by the compiler if compatible.
  - Example:
    ```java
    int x = 'A'; // Valid, as 'A' is converted to its ASCII value.
    ```
- **Explicit Conversion** (Type Casting):
  - Done manually by the programmer.
  - Example:
    ```java
    double d = 10.5;
    int i = (int) d; // Explicit conversion from double to int.
    ```

### **Conditions for Implicit Conversion**:
1. The values must be compatible.
2. The target data type should be larger than the source data type.
