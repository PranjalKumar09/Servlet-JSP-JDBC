# Java SE 17 Developer (1Z0-829) Concurrency Notes

## ExecutorService Creation

- **Executors Class**: `java.util.concurrent.Executors` provides factory methods to create `ExecutorService` instances:
  - **FixedThreadPool**: Reuses a fixed number of threads.
  - **WorkStealingPool**: Maintains threads to support a specified parallelism level.
  - **SingleThreadExecutor**: Uses a single worker thread.
  - **CachedThreadPool**: Creates new threads as needed or reuses existing ones.
  - **ScheduledThreadPool**: Schedules tasks with delays or periodically.
  - **SingleThreadScheduledExecutor**: Schedules tasks with delays using a single thread.
  - **UnconfigurableExecutorService**: Wraps an `ExecutorService` to prevent configuration changes.
- **Example**:

```java
Runnable task = () -> { /* Concurrent actions */ };
ScheduledExecutorService ses = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(3);
ses.scheduleAtFixedRate(task, 10, 5, TimeUnit.SECONDS); // Runs every 5s, initial delay 10s
ExecutorService es = Executors.unconfigurableExecutorService(ses);
```

## ExecutorService Usage

- **FixedThreadPool Example**:

```java
ExecutorService pool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);
for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    int taskId = i;
    pool.submit(() -> {
        System.out.println("Task " + taskId + " started by " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        try {
            Thread.sleep(2000); // Simulate work
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            System.out.println("Task " + taskId + " interrupted!");
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
        System.out.println("Task " + taskId + " finished by " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    });
}
pool.shutdown(); // Initiates orderly shutdown
try {
    if (!pool.awaitTermination(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
        List<Runnable> notStarted = pool.shutdownNow(); // Cancels running/pending tasks
        System.out.println("Cancelled " + notStarted.size() + " tasks.");
    }
} catch (InterruptedException e) {
    List<Runnable> notStarted = pool.shutdownNow();
    System.out.println("Cancelled " + notStarted.size() + " tasks.");
    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
}
```

## Runnable vs. Callable

- **Runnable**:
  - Implements `public void run()` from `Runnable` interface.
  - Launched via `ExecutorService.execute()` or `submit()`.
  - No return value or checked exceptions.
- **Callable**:
  - Implements `public T call() throws Exception` from `Callable` interface.
  - Launched via `ExecutorService.submit()`.
  - Returns a value wrapped in a `Future` object, which is returned immediately.
  - `Future.get(timeout, unit)` blocks until the result is available or timeout occurs.
- **Example**:

```java
Callable<String> task = () -> "some value";
ExecutorService es = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);
Future<String> result = es.submit(task);
try {
    String value = result.get(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
} catch (Exception e) {
    // Handle TimeoutException, ExecutionException, or InterruptedException
}
```

## Concurrency Issues

- **Starvation**: A thread is repeatedly denied resource access due to other threads monopolizing it.
  - Example: `synchronized(a) {}       synchronized(a) {}` blocks waiting threads if `a` is held indefinitely.
- **Livelock**: Threads loop indefinitely, waiting for each other to complete.
  - Example: Two threads in `while(otherA.isOver()) {} otherB = true  while(otherB.isOver()) {}` loops, setting their own flags but never progressing.
- **Deadlock**: Two or more threads block, each waiting for a resource the other holds.
  - Example:

```java
synchronized(a) { synchronized(b) {} }
synchronized(b) { synchronized(a) {} }
```

- **Mitigation**: Minimize `synchronized` block usage and ensure consistent lock ordering.

## Thread Safety

- **Stack Values**: Local variables and method arguments are thread-safe (each thread has its own stack).
- **Heap Memory**:
  - **Immutable Objects**: Thread-safe as they cannot be modified.
  - **Mutable Objects**: Thread-unsafe due to shared heap memory. Modifications can lead to inconsistency or corruption.
  - Compiler may cache heap values locally, missing updates from other threads.
- **Ensuring Consistency**:


- Use `volatile` keyword to prevent caching of shared variables, forcing reads from main memory.

Example: `volatile int sharedValue;` ensures consistent access across threads.

Number of threads created by the Executor depends on how the Executor instance was created. not on cpu core




A livelock happens whens multiple threads keep trying to acquire a lock but none of the threads are able to get the lock and none of the threads end up in the blocked state. \\\It will not cause a deadlock because resources are being acquired in the same order by each thread and also released in the reverse order.




The identifier var is not a keyword; instead it is a reserved type name. This means that code can still use var as a variable, method, or package name. But code cannot use var as a class or interface name.
