Create Executor Service objects
    java.util.concurrent.Extensions class provide no of thread management automation using different ExecutorService objects
        Fixed Thread Pool reuses fixed no of thread
        Work Stealing Pool maintains enough thred to support given parrallism level
        Single thread executor uses single worker thread
        Cached Thread Pool creates      new thread as needed    or reuses existing threads
        Scheduled Thread Pool schedules tasks to execute with dealy and/or periodically
        Single Thread Scheduled Executor schedules tasks to execute with delay using single worker thread
        unconfigurable executor service provide way to freeze another executor service configuration

    Runnable task = () -> { // perform concurrent actions };
    ScheduledExecutorService ses= Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(3);
    ses.scheduleAtFixedRate(task, 10, 5, TimeUnit.SECONDS); // schedule one or more takss different delays & periods using same thread pool
    ExecutorService es = Executors.unconfigurableExecutorService(ses);


schedules runnable task to executed very 5 seconds with intial delay of 10 second

        ExecutorService pool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);

        // Launch 10 runnable tasks
        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
            int taskId = i;
            pool.submit(() -> {
                try {
                    System.out.println("Task " + taskId + " started by " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
                    Thread.sleep(5000); // Simulate work
                    System.out.println("Task " + taskId + " finished by " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    System.out.println("Task " + taskId + " interrupted!");
                    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                }
            });
        }

        // Launcher thread interruption and shutdown
        try {
            // Wait for all tasks to finish or timeout
            pool.shutdown();
            if (!pool.awaitTermination(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
                List<Runnable> notStarted = pool.shutdownNow(); // Cancel running and pending tasks
                System.out.println("Cancelled " + notStarted.size() + " tasks.");
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            System.out.println("Launcher thread interrupted, cancelling tasks...");
            List<Runnable> notStarted = pool.shutdownNow();
            System.out.println("Cancelled " + notStarted.size() + " tasks.");
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
    }

Runnable Object 
    Implementing public void run(); method Runnable Interface
    Launched using executed or submit method ExecutorService
Callable Object 
    Implementing public <T> call() throws Exception; method of Callable interface
    Launched using submit method executorService
    Returned value wrapped into future object, which is returned immediately
    get method block invoking thread until timeout or when value within future objct becomes available

    Callable    <String> t= new Callable<>() {
        public String call() throws Exception{
            return "some value";
        }
    }

    ExecutorService es = Executor.nowFixedThreadPool(10);
    Future <String> result = es.submit(10);
    try{
        String value = result.get(10, TimeUnits.SECONDS);
    }catch(Exception e )



public class FixedThreadPoolControl {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a fixed thread pool of size 3
        ExecutorService pool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);

        // Submit 10 runnable tasks to the pool
        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
            int taskId = i;
            pool.submit(() -> {
                System.out.println("Task " + taskId + " started by " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(2000); // Simulate work
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    System.out.println("Task " + taskId + " interrupted!");
                    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                }
                System.out.println("Task " + taskId + " finished by " + Thread.currentThread().getName());

        }

        // Shutdown the pool after submitting all tasks
        pool.shutdown();
    }


Locking Problems
    Startvation
        synchronized(a){

        }
        synchronized(a){

        }
        Thread waiting for resource blocked by busy thread
    
    LiveLock
        while(b.isOver()){

        }
        aOver = true;

        while(a.isOver()){

        }
        bOver = true
        Thread have indefinite loop, expecting confirmation of completion from each other

    Deadlock
        synchronized(a){
            synchronized(b){}
        }
         synchronized(b){
            synchronized(a){}
        }
        two or more thread block

    
    To minimize this minimized use of synchronized

Writing Thread safe
    stack values such as local variable & method arugemnt
        no other thread can we seen this portino of memory
        easy thread operates with its own stack


    immutable object in shared heap memory are thread safe because they cant be changed at all
    mutable object in shared heap memory are thread unsafe
        heap memory is shared among all threads
        heap values undergo modification
            inconsistent
            corrupted
    compiler may choose cahce heap value locally not to notice data been changed by another thread

Ensure Consistent Access to Shared data
    Disable compiler optimization that is caching shared value locally by thread
    the volatile keyword instruct compiler
        not to chache variable
        always read it from  main memory
        applies all cha
