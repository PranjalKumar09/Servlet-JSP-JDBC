# Java Input/Output (I/O) Principles

## Overview
- I/O operations transfer data through interconnected streams.
- Key packages: `java.io` (standard I/O) and `java.nio` (advanced I/O).
- **Abstract Classes**: Define general behavior for reading/writing text and binary data.
- **Concrete Classes**: Extend abstract classes to connect to various sources/destinations, transform stream content, or build content.

## Reading Streams
- **Binary Input (`InputStream`)**:
  - `FileInputStream`: Reads bytes from a file.
  - `ObjectInputStream`: Reads serialized objects.
  - `PipedInputStream`: Reads from a piped output stream.
- **Character Input (`Reader`)**:
  - `BufferedReader`: Buffers character input, provides `readLine()`.
  - `InputStreamReader`: Converts bytes to characters.
    - `FileReader`: Reads characters from a file.
  - `PipedReader`: Reads from a piped writer.
  - `URLReader`: Reads from a URL (non-standard, typically `URL.openStream()`).

### `InputStream` Methods
- `int read()`: Reads one byte, returns -1 at end of stream.
- `int read(byte[] b)`: Reads bytes into an array, returns number of bytes read or -1.
- `int read(byte[] b, int off, int len)`: Reads up to `len` bytes into array starting at `off`.
- `void skip(long n)`: Skips `n` bytes.
- `int available()`: Returns number of bytes available without blocking.
- `void close()`: Closes stream, releases resources.
- `void mark(int readlimit)`: Marks current position.
- `void reset()`: Resets to the last mark.
- `boolean markSupported()`: Checks if marking is supported.

### `Reader` Methods
- `int read()`: Reads one character, returns -1 at end of stream.
- `int read(char[] cbuf)`: Reads characters into an array.
- `int read(char[] cbuf, int off, int len)`: Reads up to `len` characters into array starting at `off`.
- `int read(CharBuffer buffer)`: Reads into a `CharBuffer`.
- `boolean ready()`: Checks if the stream is ready to read.
- `long skip(long n)`: Skips `n` characters.
- `void close()`: Closes stream, releases resources.

## Writing Streams
- **Binary Output (`OutputStream`)**:
  - `FileOutputStream`: Writes bytes to a file.
  - `ObjectOutputStream`: Writes serialized objects.
  - `PipedOutputStream`: Writes to a piped input stream.
- **Character Output (`Writer`)**:
  - `BufferedWriter`: Buffers character output.
  - `OutputStreamWriter`: Converts characters to bytes.
    - `FileWriter`: Writes characters to a file.
  - `PipedWriter`: Writes to a piped reader.
  - `URLWriter`: Non-standard, typically not used directly.

### `OutputStream` Methods
- `void write(int b)`: Writes one byte.
- `void byte[] b)`: Writes all bytes from the array.
- `void write(byte[] b, int off, int len)`: Writes `len` bytes from array starting at `off`.
- `void close()`: Closes stream, releases resources.

### `Writer` Methods
- `void write(int c)`: Writes one character.
- `void write(char[] cbuf)`: Writes an array of characters.
- `void write(char[] cbuf, int off, int len)`: Writes `len` characters from array starting at `off`.
- `void write(String str)`: Writes a string.
- `void write(String str, int off, int len)`: Writes `len` characters from string starting at `off`.
- `void close()`: Closes stream, releases resources.

## AutoCloseable Interface
- Both `InputStream` and `Reader` (and their output counterparts) implement `AutoCloseable`.
- Use with try-with-resources for automatic closure:
  ```java
  try (InputStream in = new FileInputStream("input.txt");
       OutputStream out = new FileOutputStream("output.txt")) {
      byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];
      int bytesRead;
      while ((bytesRead = in.read(buffer, 0, buffer.length)) != -1) {
          out.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);
          System.out.println("Read " + bytesRead + " bytes");
      }
  } catch (IOException e) {
      e.printStackTrace();
  }
  ```
- Without try-with-resources, streams must be closed explicitly in a `finally` block.

### Reading Behavior
- `read` methods populate a buffer and return:
  - Buffer length for full reads.
  - Remaining data length for partial reads.
  - `-1` to indicate end of stream.

### Character I/O Example
```java
try (Reader reader = new StringReader("text");
     Writer writer = new OutputStreamWriter(
         new ByteArrayOutputStream(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8)) {
    char[] buffer = new char[1024];
    int charsRead;
    while ((charsRead = reader.read(buffer, 0, buffer.length)) != -1) {
        writer.write(buffer, 0, charsRead);
        System.out.println("Read " + charsRead + " chars: " + new String(buffer, 0, charsRead));
    }
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

## Character Encoding
- Use `Charset` for encoding/decoding:
  ```java
  Charset utf8 = Charset.forName("UTF-8");
  Reader reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("some.txt"), utf8);
  ```

## Connecting Streams
- Streams can be chained to transform, filter, or buffer data.
- Example (Reading from a file):
  ```java
  try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(
           new InputStreamReader(
               new FileInputStream("input.txt"), "UTF-8"))) {
      String line;
      while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
          System.out.println("Read: " + line);
      }
  } catch (IOException e) {
      e.printStackTrace();
  }
  ```
- **Chain**: `FileInputStream` (reads bytes) → `InputStreamReader` (converts bytes to chars) → `BufferedReader` (provides `readLine()`).

- Example (Writing to a file):
  ```java
  try (PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(
           new OutputStreamWriter(
               new FileOutputStream("output.txt"), "UTF-8"))) {
      writer.println("Hello, world!");
      writer.println("Writing with PrintWriter.");
  } catch (IOException e) {
      e.printStackTrace();
  }
  ```
- **Chain**: `FileOutputStream` (writes bytes) → `OutputStreamWriter` (converts chars to bytes) → `PrintWriter` (provides `println()`).

## Key Stream Classes
- **BufferedReader**: Provides `readLine()` for efficient line-by-line reading.
- **PrintWriter**: Provides `println()` for formatted output.
- **InputStreamReader/OutputStreamWriter**: Bridge between byte and character streams.
