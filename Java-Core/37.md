Generics

without generic we have to use Object but to ensure type safety we use generics
Without generic in object it is risk of replace by any object, it is bulky code

public class ClassName<T> {
    public:
    private T value;
    private T getValue(){
        return value;
    }
}
There can be marker other than T


Some<Product> some = new Some<>();

can we used with class & interface both


like -> public interface Comparable<T>{
    int compareTo(T o);
}

public interface Comparator<T>{
    int compare(T o1, T  o2);
}


// less than -> -ve
// more than -> +ve
// equal -> 0


ex->
public class ProductSorter implements Comparator<Product>{
    public int compare(Product p1, Product p2){
        return p1.getName().compareTo(p2.getName());
    }
}
String, LocalDate, BigDecimal etc already have implmented int compare

genreic cant be applied to 
    * Descendent of Throwable
    * Anonymous classes
    * Enumeration


Some<Product> some = new Some(); compile with warning


Following will compile but no information will available
Some some5 = new Some<Product>();

Some some6 = new Some(); its object type



composition pattern
a class may represent composition of features implemented by different other classes

like
public class Account implements WithDrawing, Depositing ....{
    ....
}public class Bank implements WithDrawing, Depositing. Authentication ....{
    ....
    public Account account;
    public ... methodOfWithDrawing(){
        return account.methodOfWithDrawing();
    }
}

more flexiblity 


sorting in array

java.util.Arrays


public class LengthCompare implements Comparator<String>{
    ---
}

Arrays.sort(name1, name2, new LengthCompare())


in syantax this is correct
int[] values= {2,12,3,5,5};
int sum = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < values.length; sum+=i++);



Arrays.copy(<array>,<new length> )
Arrays.copyOfRange(<array>,<start>, <end>)


Iterable<T> is top level interface that allow  any collection to be used forEach loop
Collection<E> extends iterable &  describe generic capabilities

various class like List<E>, Set<E>, SortedSet<E> , Map<K, V> extend it


nested class
    static class
    member inner
    local inner: private inner class  ,we needed this inside only , not outside, less usability
        can be created outside (by other method), but its private

    anonymous

    annoymous inner class  is an implemented implmentaion or extension of interface or class
    it extends parent class or implement an interface to override operations, it ism implemented inline and instiated immediately
    outer method local variable and pareameter can be accessed if they are final or effectively final





    like instead of extending it =>

    Order order = new Order(){
        @Override
        public BigDecimal getDiscount(){
            return BigDecimal.valueOf(0.1);
        }
    }

    Outer method local variable and parameter can only be accessed if they are final or effectively final 


    genearlly we seen it in Collections.sort..
    like 
    List<Product> products = ...
    Collections.sort(products, new Comparator<Product>(){
        public int compare(Product p1, Product p2){
            return p1.getName().compareTo(p2.getName());
        }
    })

        

Invocation context ->   Collections.sort(products, <Comparator>)

lambda->
  Collections.sort(products, (p1, p2) -> n p1.getName().compareTo(p2.getName()))


default method provided by java.util.Comparator interface
    * thenComparing adds additional comparators
    * reversed reverse sorting order
Examples of static method provided by Comparator interface
    * nullsFirst & nullsLast return Comparators that enable sorting collection with null values


Comparator<Product> sortNames = (p1, p2) -> p1.getName().compareTo(p2.getName());
Comparator<Product> sortNames = (p1, p2) -> p1.getName().compareTo(p2.getPrice());
Collections.sort(menu, sortNames.thenComparing(sortPrices).reversed());
menu.add(null);
Collections.sort(menu, Comparator.nullsFirst(sortPrices));

, the outer class has access to all members (including private constructors, fields, and methods) of its inner classe

now again i am weekly journaling after 2 week, now came to hostel, oh yeah welcome to hostel dyanmics

now from starting

in bus from sidhi to rewa i  meeted a person beside me Aman Pandey actaully he helped in finding my mobike phone, which was fallen below bus seat , i was worried, for moment,, but after relived, ,, afer comig to railway station i com e to know that he was travelling on  same traing and going same destination but we both have different compartment,
