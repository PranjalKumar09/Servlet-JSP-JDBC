constructor
   1) if you writing it, write in 1st line only super or this in 1st line only

    public Test(){
        S.o.p("cons")
        super();
    }

    // error

2) so when we dont write extend and use super then implicitly it does call object class

3)

public Test(){
        super();
        this();
    }
error, we can call only one
    
4)
    super.x 
    super.y()
    this.x 
    this.y()

    used as keyword

    we can take super() or this() only in constructor as 1st line only but not both simultaneously
