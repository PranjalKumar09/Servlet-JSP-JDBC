when we createbobject with new memory is allocated to it, even through it not alloicated

this -> recursive reference

var is local variable type string
    harder to read
var str= "hello" ; // taken as string
var no = param; // infers int


to restrict accidently reassignemnt => use finally

   public void setId(final int id) {
        this.id = id;
    }




### üìù **Java Varargs vs Arrays ‚Äì Concise Notes**

#### ‚úÖ Similarities:

* `Student... s` is **syntactic sugar** for `Student[] s`.
* At **runtime**, both are treated as **arrays** (`Student[]`).

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Differences:

* **Declaration Style**:
  `Student[]` ‚Äì standard array
  `Student...` ‚Äì varargs (allows 0 or more arguments)

* **Method Call**:
  Varargs can be called like: `print(s1, s2, s3)`
  Arrays require: `print(new Student[]{s1, s2, s3})`

#### ‚ùå Overloading:

* You **cannot overload** a method by just switching between `Student[]` and `Student...`:

  ```java
  void test(Student[] s) { }
  void test(Student... s) { } // ‚ùå Compile-time error
  ```

  ‚û§ **Reason**: Both compile to the **same method signature**: `test(Student[])`

#### ‚úÖ Use-Cases:

* Use `Student...` for flexible method arguments.
* Use `Student[]` when passing or manipulating arrays explicitly.

immutable objects are thread safe


enum  provide fixed set of instance of specific type 
they are implicitly public static final
other than this it can have other variable, cahractersti, method hvae
.. x  = HOT("THIS IS HOT");
S.o.p(x.serve()); //THIS IS HOT
// also for above there should constructor other wise above thing not possible

every enum has ordinal and name properties
S.o.p(x.ordinal());
S.o.p(x.name());


java memory allocation
stack is memory context of thread, storing local method variable
heap is shared memory area, accessible from different and thread context
stack hold only premetive and object reference
classes & object stored in heap


add: 2L95
Passing parameter means copying stack values:
    a copy of an object reference value
    a copy of permitive value
