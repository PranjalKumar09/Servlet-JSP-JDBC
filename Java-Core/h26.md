sub/super both having display method 

SuperClass sup = sub; // Upcasting: A SubClass object IS-A SuperClass object

((SuperClass) sub).display();


here subclass version will called




inner class can have same variable name is outer class




in this line
LocalDate d3 = LocalDate.now().plusYears(3).minusMonths(4);
3 object created



It is ok to add an Integer object and an int value




abstract class Calculator{
   abstract void calculate();
   public static void main(String[] args){
      System.out.println("calculating");
      Calculator x = null;
      x.calculate();
   }
}
It will print calculating and then throw NullPointerException.
After printing, when it tries to call calculate() on x, it will throw NullPointerException because x is null.
