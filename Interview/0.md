bean factory

annoation: itz based on Application context not bean factory  :[text](../SpringFramework/Sterotype_annotation_Scopes.md)

however bean factory is lazy loading while application context is aggressive loading



working of spring boot
    spring boot starts by scanning starter dependencies in pom.xml
    Then download & auto-configure module as you included in pom.xml
    
    We put spring-boot-starter-web in spring boot, when we start  project , it download dependencies like in Spring MVC

Start of spring boot starts
    main class
        then run method
    SpringBootApplication annotation comes
        by which Configuration, ComponentScan inside it


top annotation 
    SpringBootApplication
    Component
    Autowired
    Service
    RestController
    RequestMapping
    Repository

Spring boot starters
    are collection of pre configured dependencies that make it easier to develop particular kinds of applications
    include all of  dependencies, version control & configuration  needed to make certain features of spring boot application functional

    Key dependencies of spring boot
        spring-boot-starter-parent
        spring-boot-starter-plugin
        spring-boot-starter-test
        spring-boot-starter-security
        spring-boot-starter-actuator
        spring-boot-starter-web



Can we use only spring boot dependency feature & configure maven plugin manually
    Yes
    We dont inherit from  spring-boot-starter-parent pom
    Include spring-boot-dependencies dependency inside dependencyManagement service section as an import scope
     <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-dependencies</artifactId>
            <scope>import</scope>
            <type>pom</type>
        </dependency>

    like this

spring cli
    to navigate from command line interface
        spring init
spring run
spring install
spring help
spring shell
spring --debug

spring init -d web project_name




In constructor injection is important to remember type & order of constructor parameter
constuctor injectoin is madjorty dependecies & setter is optional
